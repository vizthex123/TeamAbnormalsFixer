This datapack fixes the missing recipes from [Autumnity](https://modrinth.com/mod/autumnity) and [Upgrade Aquatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/upgrade-aquatic), which the developers stated are "for Woodworks compat" in an [issue report](https://github.com/team-abnormals/upgrade-aquatic/issues/403) I filed.

I figured it was about time to just fix them myself since they haven't done so yet, and although I'd normally use [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs) I figured I'd make it into a datapack so it can be easily used by others who are also bothered by this oversight.
