# Team Abnormals Recipe Fixer

Fixes the missing recipes from Team Abnormal's mods. They're meant to be used for Woodworks, and although I did [report it](https://github.com/team-abnormals/upgrade-aquatic/issues/403) the devs didn't want to fix it (even though it's not that hard?)

So, I decided to fix them myself since they're not interested.
